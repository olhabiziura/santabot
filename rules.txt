What is Secret Santa? 🎅
Secret Santa is a fun holiday tradition where participants exchange Christmas gifts with a randomly assigned person, without knowing who their Secret Santa is. The goal is to surprise and delight someone with a thoughtful gift while maintaining anonymity throughout the process.

How to play? 🎁

Registration:

Anyone who wants to join must sign up by sending a registration command (e.g., /join) and answering a few questions to help with the gift assignment.
Registration will be open for a limited time, so make sure to sign up before the deadline!
Secret Santa Assignment:

On a scheduled date, participants will be randomly assigned a recipient. You will be informed of who you're buying for, but you won’t know who is buying for you!
Preparing Your Gift:

Participants will have a set period to prepare their gifts. This includes asking your recipient up to three questions to get an idea of their preferences.
Be thoughtful with your questions to keep the surprise element intact, and try not to reveal too much about yourself!
Sending the Gift:

The gift must be delivered secretly, and you should only sign it with your recipient's name. It’s part of the fun to try and guess who your Secret Santa is by the end of the game!
You may choose to deliver the gift in person or have someone else deliver it on your behalf. Alternatively, you could arrange a specific time and place for the recipient to pick it up.
Budget:

Secret Santa is not about expensive gifts, but about spreading joy and creating a festive atmosphere. The recommended budget for your gift should be modest (e.g., around 5-6 euros).
Feel free to add a personal touch with a handwritten note or a thoughtful gesture!
Revealing the Secret:

If you’re unable to guess who your Secret Santa is by the end of the game, your Secret Santa’s identity will be revealed to you!
Important Rules:

Stay anonymous and keep the mystery alive!
Be respectful and mindful of your language, as violations of the game rules can result in being banned.
Most importantly, have fun and enjoy the holiday spirit!
