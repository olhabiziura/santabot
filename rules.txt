First of all, what is Secret Santa?🤔

🤓 It is a game in which each person in a group of players gives a Christmas gift to randomly assigned person, without one not knowing who prepared it

And most importantly, how are we going to play it?😋

Here are the game steps: 

29.11 - 3.01 : People who want to take part in the game has to register by sending /join command to SS assistant and answering follow-up questions🙋‍♀️🙋‍♂️
❗️Registration will be strictly closed on 3/01, 23:59

On weekends we will randomly assign Secret Santas and inform you on your recipient😋 

6/01 - 12/01 : During this week you have to prepare your present🙌🏻
❗️IMPORTANT: we will give you opportunity to chat a little bit with both your Secret Santa and recipient. 
As Secret Santa, you can ask up to (only!) 3️⃣ questions. Think thoroughly before sending any messages
As a recipient, you can send unlimited amount of messages to your Secret Santa
❗️ BUT
- Be careful to not reveal your personality to anyone. Let’s keep the game intriguing for every player till the very end🍊
- Please watch your language. Players can be banned for inappropriate behaviour or game rules violation😕


🎁 13/01 - 17/01 : Finally, it’s time to secretly deliver your gift! Be careful and stay anonymous🥸 Sign your gift with recipient’s name only. Don’t forget that one has to guess who you are😜 

Little tip: you can ask someone else to deliver your gift OR assign time and place where one may pick it up📦💌

If you don’t get to guess your Secret Santa by the end of the game, we will reveal one’s personality to you✨ 

💰 BUDGET : Secret Santa is not about gifts, it is about creating a Christmas mood, right? Therefore, I would suggest you not to buy anything that costs more than 5-6 euros.
If you want to make your gift better or even priceless - attach a note with a few cheering up words ;)
